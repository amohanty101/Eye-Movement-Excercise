The task is to add a "eye" element and have that element follow the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events.

## How to Run: 
Fork repo to access the 3 starter files
- eyes.js
- index.html
- styles.css

 The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. You can walk through the code to see how this all works.


## Roadmap of future improvements: 
- Add a thrid eye
- get the eye blink at a certain event
